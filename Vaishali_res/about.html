                <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Jagannath B.Shetty</h2><br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Shri. Jagannath B. Shetty is a pioneer in the business 
                    of restaurants in Pune. He has established the
                     immensely popular trinity Vaishali, Roopali and Amrapali.
                     He came to Pune 58 years ago to join his maternal uncle
                     Late Shridhar Shetty in his hotel business.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">He was born on 8th October 1932 in Onimajalu mane in
                    Bailur,a small village near karkalla in south kanara. 
                    Jagannath Shetty left home at the age of thirteen to work in kalyan with his
                    uncle for Rs, 3 a month. The ambitious young boy then came to Pune in 1949 
                    at the age of 17.The teen-aged Jagannath, worked hard from the early hours 
                    of the morning till late night.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">This hard work bore fruit when he started Café Madras 
                    (present day Roopali) in 1951 and later Madras Health home, now the very 'in' 
                    place, Vaishali. But everything was not a bed of roses and Jagannath Shetty 
                    had to work hard to achieve that success.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Vaishali in those days was a tiny restaurant. However, 
                    Jagannath Shetty's toil brought rich dividends. His restaurants as they are now, 
                    are products of nineteen hours of continuous work everyday, for a span of twenty 
                    years. Today his restaurants have become household name in Pune and are popular 
                    spots for both the young and the old alike. Celebrities frequently visit these 
                    restaurants.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">He has several awards to his credit. He was awarded 
                    'The Gunduraj Shetty gold medal for the best social worker' for his selfless 
                    contribution to the society. Continuously he has bagged the 'Cleanest kitchen 
                    award' from the Pune Municipal Corporation for several years now .For the 
                    significant work in the field of quality, The Entrepreneurs International 
                    Conferred 'Quality Award' to his restaurant Vaishali, on 29th July 2003.Tridal 
                    Pune Felicitated him with Pune's most prestigious award "Punya Bhushan Puraskar" 
                    in the year 2000. Recently The Times Group has declared VAISHALI as the Best 
                    South Indian Restaurant. Chimanlal Govinddas Memorial Trust has also awarded him 
                    with “Udyam Gaurav Purskar”.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Dowry is a social evil prevailing in our community. 
                    J. B. Shetty instituted gold medals to newly married outstanding couple i.e. those 
                    who marry without accepting 'Dowry'. Once a year all the Bunts in Pune gather for their 
                    annual day, where a renowned member of the community is invited as the chief guest.. 
                    The guest then bestows the medal to the deserving couple. This is indeed an honor for 
                    the couple. In this way Jagannath Shetty encourages the men in Pune to oppose dowry. 
                    He has also helped many parents to get their daughters married.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Though he has settled down in Pune, he has not forgotten his 
                    native place. he has generously given donations to his old school for development, and 
                    build the village Ganapathi Temple.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Jagannath Shetty is an ardent golfer and has Captained Poona golf 
                    club in the year 1997-98”If I don't play golf even for one day, I feel very uneasy”,says 
                    J.B Shetty. He has won several awards too. He has started an annual “Vaishali Cup” for 
                    amateurs.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;"></p>He has traveled widely all over the world .in all his social 
                    activities he had the fullest co-operation of his better half late Smt. Shakuntala Shetty. 
                    They have a daughter Kum. Nikita.<br>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">There must be something intrinsically astounding in an individual 
                    who has achieved such heights without the benefit of either an academic or technical 
                    education. He deserves full appreciation from one and all.</p><br>
